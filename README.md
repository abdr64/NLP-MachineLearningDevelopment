# Natural Language Processing - Submission 01
In submission section, the student must build a machine learning model for text classification and meet the submission criteria.

The criteria's are:

 - Any text dataset with a minimum of **1000 samples**
 - Must use **LSTM** in the model
 - A model must be built in **Sequential**
 - Validation set must be **20%** of the dataset
 - Must use **Embedding**
 - Must use **Tokenizer**
 - Accuracy is at a minimum of **75%**

Reviewers will give ratings by scaling from 1 - 5 based on the code when the task has met the criteria.

The details of the ratings are: 

 1. Indicated of plagiarism
 2. The code needs to be fixed
 3. Only to follow the modules provided in the course
 4. Using a dataset with **2000 samples** as well as the accuracy of both **training set** and **validation set** are at least **85%**
 5. Using a dataset with more than or equal to **three classes**, **2000 samples** as well as the accuracy of **training set** and **validation set** are above **90%**

 The code in this repository is a result of my NLP work
